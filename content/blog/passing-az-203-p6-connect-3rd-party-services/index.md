## Develop an App Service Logic App

A Logic App is a workflow you define to execute actions based on events, kind of an IFTTT version for your Azure subscription.

üëâ For example, you could define a Logic App to check the blobs you have in a container and if they are older than a month, send a message to a queue so that an app could process them and move them to a less expensive archive storage.

üí° In the exam, I was asked to drag-drop activities into a workflow.

## Retry Policies 

Review the 4 different retry policies and their [JSON representations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-exception-handling#retry-policies).

| Retry Policy         | Details           
| --------------- |:-------------
| *Default*      | 4 exponential retries: intervals of 7.5 seconds, 12.5, 19.5....
| *Fixed interval*      | interval: PT20S (every 20 seconds express in ISO format)      
| *Exponential interval* | Minimun interval: PT10S, Maximum interval: PT1H
| *None* | Don't resend the request

## Azure Search
Creating and populating a search index with data.

### SearchServiceClient


```c#
// The operations related to managing indexes are performed using a `SearchServiceClient` object.

var serviceClient = new SearchServiceClient(
    "my-search-service-name",
    new SearchCredentials(adminApiKey)
);
```

### Create an index

``` c#
// Create an index with a list of fields with the [IsSearchable] attribute in the Order class.

var definition = new Index()
{
    Name = "orders",
    Fields = FieldBuilder.BuildForType<Order>()
};
serviceClient.Indexes.Create(definition)
```

### Prepare a batch of documents for upload

```c#
var indexClientForUpload = serviceClient.Indexes.GetClient("orders");

var batch = IndexBatch.Upload(orders); // orders being an array of Order objects.


```

### Actually upload the orders

```c#
indexClientForUpload.Documents.Index(batch);

```


### Search

```c#
var indexClientForQuery = new SearchIndexClient(
    "my-search-service-name",
    "orders",
    new SearchCredentials(queryApiKey)
);

var parameters = new SearchParameters() 
{
    Select = new[] { "orderNumber" }
};

var results = indexClientForQuery.Documents.Search<Order>("1234", parameters);
```

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: If results are missing in a search, make sure the properties in your class are "searchable".

## API Gateways

üí°Know the 3 policy types: inbound, outbound and backend.

| Policy Type        | Details     | Common uses      
| --------------- |:------------- |:-------------
| *Inbound*      | Applied on the request when coming into the API | authentication, rate limiting, caching
| *Outbound*      | Applied on outbound information from the API | filter and transformation of data, caching
| *Backend* | Applied before calling a backend service and after a response from that service | transformation of data (xml-json), retry

üí°If you are asked what type of policy to use to secure API access with OpenID, the answer is the `validate-jwt` policy.

## Event Grid

The Event Grid can be really helpful to build the backbone of serverless applications and event-driven applications. 

üí°What's an event? A report in change of state of something. Events are then sent to topics. All subscribers of the topic will receive the event.

```json
{
    "destination": {
        "endpointBaseUrl": "https://my-id.ngrok.io/api/updates",
        "endpointType": "WebHook",      
        "endpointUrl": null
    },
    "filter": {
        "includedEventTypes": [
            "Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated"
        ],
        "subjectBeginsWith": "/blobServices/default/containers/testcontainer"
    }
}
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to understand the JSON for configuring a blob-created event subscription.

- [Choose between Azure messaging services - Event Grid, Event Hubs, and Service Bus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/compare-messaging-services)


## Service Bus


*Create a queue*
``` bash
az servicebus queue create
    --namespace-name az203sb
    -g servicebus
    -n testqueue
```

Or the equivalent powershell command:

``` ps
New-AzureRmServiceBusQueue
    -ResourceGroupName servicebus
    -NamespaceName az203sb
    -name testqueue
    -EnablePartitioning false
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Note that there are some questions in the exam where the answers are in Powershell.

### Request/Reply patterns

TODO: Add diagram

*Single reply queue (**correlationId**)*

*Reply queue for each client (**replyTo**)*

*Sessions (**replyToSessionId**)*
