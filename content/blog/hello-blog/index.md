That's what I said to myself every time I thought of putting up my own blog. 
You know, that lizard brain whispering right into your ear: _What's the point? Yet another tech blog? 
Isn't **everything** already out there? Do I have anything to say?..._

Often times, when learning something new, I find myself going back to the same thing days later and asking 
_"how do I do that again?"_, and then wondering _"if only I had written it somewhere..."_

So let's do it. 

Doesn't matter how big (or small, or unexisting) your audience is. Just start. 
That side project that has been bouncing in your head for a while, learning a new skill...

Take that first step. The most difficult of them all.
