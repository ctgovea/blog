In this post I'll share my notes for clearing the Developing Solutions for Azure (AZ-203) exam. 

Note that Microsoft has made available a new [AZ-204](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-204) version. 
However, you can still take the AZ-203 until August 31, 2020.

For each of the 5 skills measured in the exam *(only 4 in the AZ-204, looks like they merged the first 2 into a single one)*, I'll highlight the main points you need to study.

The AZ-203 is quite code heavy. It requires you to be familiar with the Azure CLI commands to create and manage your cloud resources. But don't worry, you will not need to write code and memorize every single parameter, you do need, however, to be able to recognize the correct command. The exam will present you multiple options and you should select the code that corresponds to the task at hand.

**Skills measured**

- Develop Azure Infrastructure as a Service Solutions
- Develop Azure Platform as a Service Compute Solutions
- Implement Azure Security
- Monitor, troubleshoot and optimize solutions
- Connect to and consume Azure and third-party services
