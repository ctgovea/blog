In this post I'll share my notes for clearing the Developing Solutions for Azure (AZ-203) exam. 

⚠️ Note that Microsoft has made available a new [AZ-204](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-204) version. 
However, you can still take the AZ-203 until August 31, 2020. ⚠

For each of the 6 skills measured in the exam *(only 5 in the AZ-204, looks like they merged the first 2 - infrastructure and platform- into a single one)*, I'll highlight the main points you need to study.

The AZ-203 is quite code heavy. It requires you to be familiar with the Azure CLI commands and C# code to create and manage your cloud resources. But don't worry, you will not need to write code and memorize every single parameter. You do need, however, to be able to recognize the correct option. The exam will present you multiple options and you should select the code that corresponds to the task at hand.

## Resources

- See the [exam skills outline](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3VEHC), from Microsoft, with the list of things you need to know.
- Study the modules listed in the [Learning path for Azure Developer](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWtQqM)
- I highly recommend taking the course [Microsoft Certified Azure Developer – Exam AZ-203 Prep](https://linuxacademy.com/course/microsoft-certified-azure-developer-exam-az-203-prep/) on Linux Academy. They have labs where you can spin up cloud resources and get hands-on experience and the pace of the course is pretty good. Most of the notes in this study guide come from this course.
